#  Instacart Market Basket Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling pipeline based on the **Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset**. The work is part of a dissertation focusing on transaction data mining, recommendation systems, and customer segmentation.

##  Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main objectives, each represented by a dedicated Jupyter notebook:

###  Objective 1: Frequent Purchase Pattern Discovery
- **Notebook**: `Explained_Obj_1_Instacart_Analysis.ipynb`
- Performs exploratory analysis on the Instacart dataset.
- Answers 20 business questions around order behavior, product popularity, and reordering trends.

###  Objective 2: Market Basket Analysis â€“ Apriori vs FP-Growth
- **Notebook**: `Final_Complete_Obj_2_Apriori_vs_FPGrowth.ipynb`
- Compares the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms on speed, scalability, and rule generation.
- Includes detailed rule-based evaluation.

###  Objective 3: Recommendation Optimization
- **Notebook**: `Final_Complete_Obj_3_Recommendation_Optimization.ipynb`
- Leverages FP-Growth insights to create a rule-based product recommender system.
- Evaluates recommendation effectiveness.

###  Objective 4: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing
- **Notebook**: `Final_Complete_Obj_4_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`
- Uses clustering (K-Means) and PCA to segment customers.
- Derives actionable marketing insights from behavioral patterns.

###  Data Cleaning Scripts
- **Python Script**: `Script_Cleaning_Enhanced_Documented.py`
- Includes modular cleaning routines for each dataset:
  - `aisles.csv`
  - `departments.csv`
  - `orders.csv`
  - `order_products__prior.csv`
  - `order_products__train.csv`

###  Dataset Source

-  **Dataset Source**: The dataset used in this dissertation project is the **Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017**.
-  **Access**: It is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset]
    (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset)
-  **Provided By**: Originally compiled and released by **Instacart (US)**.
-  **Purpose**: Designed for enabling data analysis exercises and benchmarking recommendation systems.
-  **Usage**: Widely used in the **data science community**, especially for academic, research, and educational purposes.
##  Dataset Overview

The dataset comes from Instacart's anonymized historical data, consisting of **3 million orders from 200,000 users** and over **50,000 unique products**.

Key Files:
- `orders.csv` â€“ Sequence of user orders (time, order number, etc.)
- `products.csv` â€“ Product names and IDs
- `aisles.csv` â€“ Aisle categorization
- `departments.csv` â€“ Department categorization
- `order_products__prior.csv` â€“ Prior order details with product IDs
- `order_products__train.csv` â€“ Train order details used for recommendation modeling

###  Dataset Path Configuration

To ensure your notebooks work seamlessly across different machines and environments, the dataset loading paths have been configured using a relative folder structure.  

####  Default Setup
Place all Instacart CSV files inside a folder named `data/` in the **root directory** of this repository:

```
instacart-mba-project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orders.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ order_products__train.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ order_products__prior.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aisles.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ departments.csv
```

The code in the notebooks automatically reads files from this folder using:

```python
base_path = "../data"
orders = pd.read_csv(f"{base_path}/orders.csv")
```



#### ðŸ›  Optional: Use a Custom Dataset Path
If you prefer to store the dataset elsewhere, set an environment variable named `DATA_PATH` before running the notebook:
##  Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, mlxtend)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration and modeling
- **Plotly** and **Matplotlib** for visualizations
